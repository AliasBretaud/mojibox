## Usage

To use Mojibox in your Java project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Include Dependency**: Make sure Mojibox is included in your project's dependencies as shown above.

2. **Instantiate KanjiDictionary**: Create an instance of `KanjiDictionary` to access Kanji data.

3. **Search Kanji**: Use the `searchKanji()` method to search for a specific Kanji by its literal.

```java
KanjiDictionary kanjiDictionary = new KanjiDictionary();
KanjiEntry kanji = kanjiDictionary.searchKanji("æ¼¢");
```

4. **Access Kanji Data**: Once you have a Kanji object, you can access its readings, meanings, and other information.

```java
import io.github.aliasbretaud.mojibox.enums.MeaningLanguage;
import io.github.aliasbretaud.mojibox.enums.ReadingType;

String literal = kanji.getLiteral();
List<String> readings = kanji.getReadings().get(ReadingType.JA_ON);
List<String> meanings = kanji.getMeanings().get(MeaningLanguage.EN);
```
